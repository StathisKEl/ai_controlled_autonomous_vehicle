Artificial intelligence refers to a machine's ability to imitate elements of human behavior that imply even a rudimentary intelligence. Thus , artificial intelligence is a modern and at the same time interesting field since it does not only concern the IT industry but combines knowledge from many scientific disciplines. For these reasons , this diploma thesis has been drafted , the object of which is the construction of an autonomous wheeled robot that uses an artificial neural network in order to follow a course that will allow it each time to avoid the obstacles that are in front of it. Although this function could be achieved with a simpler way it was chosen to be implemented by constructing an artificial neural network , the purpose of which is to calculate the correct course that the robot should follow , for the reasons mentioned above but also to investigate the difficulties and generally to study the requirements of such an undertaking.
