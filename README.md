An autonomous wheeled vehicle that detects objects in front of it and finds a path to avoid them. It does this by processing data from its ultrasonic sensors through artificial intelligence, specifically through an algorithm called the backpropagation algorithm.

The code inside the code.ino file is under the GNU General Public v3.0 license and the hardware of the autonomous vehicle such as the connections between the different boards is under the CERN Open Hardware Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal license. All the informations about the GNU General Public v3.0 license can be found in the GNU GPLv3 license.txt file and all the informations about the CERN Open Hardware Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal license can be found in the CERN OHL S 2.0 license.txt file.
